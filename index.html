	<h1>Sven-Erik Ekstr√∂m</h1>
	<p>
		I have a Ph.D. in scientific computing (numerical analysis) from Uppsala University, Sweden, with the thesis "Matrix-Less Methods for Computing Eigenvalues of Large Structured Matrices". I am currently a postdoc at Athens University of Economics and Business. My main research interest is spectral analysis of PDE and FDE discretizations, and other structured matrices, using matrix-less methods and the theory of GLT sequences.
